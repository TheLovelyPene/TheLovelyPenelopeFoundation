# The Lovely Penelope Foundation – Open Build

A transparent, community-driven ecosystem for guaranteed basic needs through cooperative and mutual aid infrastructure.

---

## Overview

This repository documents the ongoing build, research, and development of the **Lovely Penelope Foundation** and its sister organization, the **Common Treasury Mutual Aid Fund (501(c)(4))**.

Our mission is simple but transformative: to create a dual nonprofit ecosystem that guarantees housing, food, utilities, healthcare, and transportation for all—powered by worker-owned cooperatives and mutual aid networks.

This space serves as our **open lab notebook**, sharing everything from governance models to project milestones and technical resources.

Transparency is at the heart of this foundation—every decision, experiment, and system design is shared to help others build their own.
